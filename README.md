# Data Structures
## Tema1: Several sorting algorithms 
sortari.py
  * radixsort (both msd and lsd)
  * countsort
  * mergesort
  * quicksort
  * insertsort
  * Tournament sorting (badly implemented tho)

teste.py - generates different kinds of lists to be sorted
  * lists containing a large number of elements
  * lists containing with big numbers
  * lists containing identical numbers
  * lists already sorted

main.py - creates an cl app for comparing different sorting methods on different input types

## Tema2: B-tree (also badly implemented)

## Tema3: Solved problems from infoarena and codeforces
